          This little frog recently made the headlines thanks to its resemblance
          to a celebrity: Kermit the Frog. It also made headlines because it's a
          newly discovered species.
        </p>
        <p>We reported earlier this month,</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "According to the official announcement on the center's website,
            this particular glass frog is unique due to its coloring, the sound
            of its call, and other morphological features — including its
            Kermit-like eyes."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          And just to ramp up the aww-factor a bit more, he named the new
          species after his mom. This miniscule frog is only about 1 inch long,
          and it's a species of glass frog. Glass frogs are called such because
          the skin on their bellies is so translucent, you can see their organs.

          The Diana's bare-hearted glass frog may be tiny but it has nothing on
          the Paedophryne amauensis, also a relatively new species to science as
          it was only discovered in August 2009.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Smaller than a dime, this tiny frog species is the world's smallest
            vertebrate."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This species grows to only 0.3 inches, making it the world's smallest
          vertebrate. For perspective, the coin it is sitting on is a dime.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          Not only is it tiny but its calls are similar to those of insects,
          plus their coloring matches the leaf litter on the forest floor. No
          wonder it took scientists awhile to notice it! The strategy used by
          the two researchers who discovered it were to use triangulation to
          determine the location of the call, then scoop leaf litter into a
          plastic bag to figure out what was making the noise. Then there it
          was, the tiniest frog in the world. Paedophryne amauensis is found in
          Papua New Guinea.

          While some frogs choose to hide, others choose to stand out. Such is
          the ornate horned frog, also known as the Argentine horned frog,
          Argentine wide-mouthed frog, and ornate Pacman frog.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "This species is sometimes called a Pacman frog because of its
            exceptionally large mouth."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Why "Pacman" frog? Because this frog will try to swallow pretty much
          anything that gets close to its unusually large mouth. The frog's menu
          includes everything from insects to rodents to other frogs.
        </p>

          It has an insatiable appetite packaged in a 6-inch body that is half
          mouth — literally. Its mouth accounts for around half of the frog's
          body. As the National Zoo puts it, "These frogs are sometimes called
          'mouths with legs' because the mouth appears to be the entire front
          half of the body." Wide-mouthed indeed! Their bite is, as you might
          expect, powerful. You don't want to get your fingers anywhere near
          these guys!

          This species ranks way up there among the froggy masters of
          camouflage. Living in subtropical and tropical lowland forests, as
          well as freshwater marshes, its skin mimics the look of moss, turning
          it into what looks like a moss-covered rock when the frog sits still.
          Even its eyes have the same textured appearance through their
          coloration. You can see how much these creatures look like the
          surrounding moss in the photo below:
        </p>
        <img

          alt="mossy frog"
          id="mossyfrog"
        />
        <p>
          The species takes that rock-like appearance to an extreme by rolling
          up into a tight ball when threatened, trying with all its might to
          look like any other rock in the area. These frogs grow to be between
          2.5-3.5 inches long, and they have an adhesive disk at the end of each
          toe that helps them easily scale rocks and trees.
